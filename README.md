About Nolus
The Nolus Protocol defines a money market between lenders looking to yield on stablecoins and borrowers looking to amplify their holdings. For borrowers, the Nolus DeFi Lease provides up to 150% financing on the initial investment with a lowered margin call risk and access to the underlying leveraged assets through whitelisted strategies.

The protocol utilizes an application-specific blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK and a WASM smart contract engine focusing on interoperability, security, and performance. Interoperability, in particular, is at the core of Nolusâ€™ offering as the Protocol utilizes IBC and Interchain Accounts to tap into a diverse set of liquidity hubs without creating fragmentation across chains. Each DeFi Lease position is a separate smart contract instance on the Nolus chain that registers an Interchain Account on a host network and facilitates swapping via an integrated exchange where the assets in the lease position are kept in the Interchain Account.
